## Actions.yml structure notes

- white or blacklist == used to build the compator structure to measure the user's chosen set of actions
- weight == alter the probabilty of the action. Doesn't have to add up to 100 but probably helps if it does
- exit == default false // whether this outcome ends the scenario
